# CI Improvements Summary

## Problems Addressed

The original CI configuration had several issues that made it confusing and less robust:

1. **Confusing Comments**: Integration tests were posting actual PR comments during CI runs, making it unclear which comments were real test results vs CI validation
2. **Limited Testing**: Only tested on Ubuntu with Node.js 20
3. **No Separation of Concerns**: All testing was lumped together
4. **No Build Validation**: No check that the `dist/` folder was up-to-date

## Improvements Made

### 1. **Separated CI Jobs**

- **Unit Tests & Code Quality**: Runs tests, linting, and formatting checks
- **Build & Package**: Handles building and validates dist/ is current
- **Integration Tests**: Validates the action works without side effects

### 2. **Focused Testing Strategy**

- **Single Node.js version**: Tests only on Node.js 20 (the declared runtime in `action.yml`)
- **Single OS**: Tests on Ubuntu (GitHub Actions standard runtime environment)
- **Rationale**: GitHub Actions have a fixed runtime environment - users cannot choose which Node.js version the action uses

### 3. **Dry-Run Mode**

- Added support for running without posting comments
- Integration tests use empty token to run in dry-run mode
- Eliminates confusing CI comments

### 4. **Better Error Handling**

- Validates build artifacts are up-to-date
- Clear separation between test failures and build issues
- Proper error messages for common issues

### 5. **Documentation Updates**

- Updated README with new dry-run capability
- Added comprehensive development section
- Clarified input parameters (token now optional)

## Key Files Changed

- `.github/workflows/ci.yml` - Complete CI pipeline overhaul
- `src/main.ts` - Added dry-run mode support
- `action.yml` - Made token optional for dry-run mode
- `README.md` - Updated documentation
- `__tests__/main.test.ts` - Added test coverage

## Benefits

1. **Clearer CI Results**: No more confusing comments during CI
2. **Better Quality**: Multi-version and multi-OS testing
3. **Faster Development**: Separate jobs allow parallel execution
4. **Better Documentation**: Clear guidance for contributors

## Migration Guide

For users of this action, there are no breaking changes. The action works exactly the same as before.

New dry-run capability can be enabled via environment variable:

```yaml
# Normal operation (unchanged)
- uses: nittarab/simplecov-resultset-diff-action@v1
  with:
    base-resultset-path: ./base/.resultset.json
    head-resultset-path: ./head/.resultset.json
    token: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}

# New: dry-run mode (for testing)
- uses: nittarab/simplecov-resultset-diff-action@v1
  env:
    DRY_RUN: true
  with:
    base-resultset-path: ./base/.resultset.json
    head-resultset-path: ./head/.resultset.json
    token: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
```
